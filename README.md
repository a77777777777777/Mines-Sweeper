If anyone feel that their code/materials are used in my application feel free to claim it. Most of the codes are written by me and the materials used are created by me/taken from internet which mostly had free license. Using your material does not entitle you to access the people who use my application unknowingly; I can guarentee that once you claimed, the material/code will be instantly removed.
